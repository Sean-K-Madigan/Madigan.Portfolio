          <p className="bio-text">I received my Bachelor's in Kinesiology from the University of Utah and went on to pursue a Master of Business Administration from Western Governor's University. I dicovered my passion for web development while selling cars at a Chevy dealership. One of my customers explained the scope of his work as a software engineer and I was hooked. The more research I did the more clear it became that I had discovered my niche. I pursued my first intro to coding class in January of 2024 and promptly enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp facilitated by a partnership between the University of Utah and edX. </p>

          <p className="bio-text">Professionally, I have a varied and diverse background that makes me highly adaptable. I have worked in child-care, mental health, emergency medicine, the restaurant and service industry, and vehicle sales in the pursuit of my passion. All of my prior experience has lead me to web development and I am excited to begin a long successful career in this industry.</p>

          <p className="bio-text">My passion for coding stems from my desire to build and turn my dreams and others' into reality. I am uniquely motivated to take on learning curves that help me evole into a more capable man and excell in many areas. I enjoy weight-lifting, climbing, skiing, surfing, and am a certified scuba divemaster to name a few of my hobbies. I'm excited to collaborate on a project or join your development team.</p>
